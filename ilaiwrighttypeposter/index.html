      <p class="a"> As THE slab serif typeface, I am a redesign of a seasoned typeface that made such an impact on typography that its name was used for all bracketed slab serifs of its time. Yes, I've had a little work done between the 1830s-40s and the 1930s-50s. How else do you think I still look so young and fresh? That's where I, the IT Girl, come into play. I possess the perfect combination of strength and curves that keep me relevant in the typographic community. Even if you haven't noticed, I show up all around you. Have you ever seen the SONY logo? Starbucks logo? Wells Fargo? What about a children's book? Yep, that's me! Now let me tell you a little bit about myself and where I came from. </p>

      <h2>BIG HAPPY FAMILY</h2>
      <p> There are many fonts within the Clarendon family (too many if you ask me). We're made up of all ages, shapes, and sizes too! My sisters, brothers, and cousins include: <span class="jobclarendon">Job Clarendon</span>, <span class="clarendonurwextrawide">Clarendon URW Etra Wide</span>, <span class="clarendonurwextranarrow">Clarendon URW Extra Narrow</span>, & <span class="clarendontextpro">Clarendon Text</span>, just to name a few.
